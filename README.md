# demo-ticTacToeGame
A demo learned from freeCodeCamp.

User story:

I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

**P.S**  So rookie I am, some logic in this project is too hard to understand for me, I need to do it by myself later when I do some further study about JavaScript.
